# Track Diagram Editor for Marklin Central Station 2 Layouts

TrackDiagramEditor a Windows program for viewing and editing the "gleisbild" layout files generated by the Marklin Central Station 2.

TrackDiagramEditor can also be used to view exported CS2 data when migrating to other controllers, such as the CS3.
